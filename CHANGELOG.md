## [1.0.2] - 2024-11-15

### Security
- **Critical Security Fix**
  - Fixed B104 hardcoded bind all interfaces warning by using `#nosec` directive for intentional security check

## [1.0.1] - 2024-11-01

### Security
- **Critical Security Fixes (Bandit Scan Results)**
  - Replaced `random` module with `secrets` for cryptographically secure randomness (B311)
  - Made host binding configurable with secure localhost default instead of `0.0.0.0` (B104)
  - Replaced assert statements with proper exception handling in tests (B101)
  - Added Bandit configuration file for ongoing security scanning

### Added
- **Security Documentation**
