## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-31

### Security
- **Critical Security Fixes (Bandit Scan Results)**
  - Replaced `random` module with `secrets` for cryptographically secure randomness (B311)
  - Made host binding configurable with secure localhost default instead of `0.0.0.0` (B104)
  - Replaced assert statements with proper exception handling in tests (B101)
  - Added Bandit configuration file for ongoing security scanning

### Added
- **Security Documentation**
  - Comprehensive `SECURITY.md` with security guidelines and best practices
  - Production deployment security checklist
  - Security monitoring and maintenance procedures

- **Production Deployment**
  - `start-production.sh` script with secure defaults
  - Environment-based configuration for host binding
  - Gunicorn integration for production deployments
  - Security warnings for development vs. production setup

### Changed
- **Enhanced Security Configuration**
  - Default host binding changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` for security
  - Environment variables control host binding (`FLASK_HOST`, `FLASK_PORT`, `FLASK_DEBUG`)
  - Production script warns when binding to all interfaces
  - Updated README.md with security features section

### Fixed
- **Security Vulnerabilities**
  - B311: Pseudo-random generators - Now using cryptographically secure `secrets.randbelow()`
  - B104: Binding to all interfaces - Now configurable with secure defaults
  - B101: Assert statements - Replaced with proper exception raising in tests
